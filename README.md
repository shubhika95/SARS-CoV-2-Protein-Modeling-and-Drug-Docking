# SARS-CoV-2-Protein-Modeling-and-Drug-Docking

In the course of this project offered by Coursera (Guided Project Program), I've familiarized myself with key tools and resources that are essential in exploring prominent structural databases, such as PDB, and have become proficient in utilizing protein visualization and analysis tools like SWISS-MODEL, PyMOL, and AutoDock Vina. These tools have not only facilitated my exploration but have also equipped me with valuable skills for future endeavors in the field.

In the realm of homology modeling, I've delved into the art of translating protein sequence data into accurate 3D structures. This involved a meticulous process of understanding the intricacies of protein folding and conformational changes. Through hands-on practice, I've honed my ability to construct 3D representations of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences, gaining insights into the structural aspects that underpin their functions.

Molecular docking led me into the realm of molecular interactions. I've learned how to simulate the binding of drug molecules to specific protein targets. This process has given me a glimpse into the intricate process of molecular recognition and has allowed me to infer essential insights into protein-drug interactions. This understanding is of paramount importance in the context of drug screening and discovery, offering potential avenues for the development of new therapeutic agents.
